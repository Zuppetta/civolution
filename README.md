# Civolution: A Conquest from the Past
Turn based strategy video game based on evolution.
The player will go through different eras (unorganised creatures, tribe, planetary and galactic civilizations).
Different approaches are possible in order to win (war, diplomaty, economy, extansion, technology, religion, tourism, ...) and this choice will affects the capacities of your civilization. The game does not allow alliance from the start, but will allows them during the game and will allows player to win together.
Different kind of alliances are possible: symbiosis (allowed in the first eras), mutuale defense/war (does not allow mutual victory), mixing society and maybe some others.

The game aims to offer some very different civilizations such as creating a vegetable or a virus civilization (other ideas are welcome) and to have some different kinds of gameplay during each era (the begining mostly based on the exploration and random discovery, the end on the economy/war/diplomaty/expansion depending on your civilization).
If a player is eliminated at early stage, he will be relocated one another world with a permanent disadvantage, a war bonus will be given at the player(s) responsible for it.

The developpement is focused on the creature era at the beginning and open to everyone, feel free to contact me if you want to be part of the team :).
We are aiming to do a game with a lot of diversity in the evolution/technology and where every decisions done during the game are important (the evolution at the beginning of the game gives some important bonus at the end). This page is only a presentation of the work, for more detail go in the GameDesign directory.

# Eras

Not everyone is at the same era.

Creatures
---------

This phase consists in the DNA evolution and defines the creature that will be played. The gameplay consists in increasing the population of creatures (at the beginning unicellular creatures) in a tiles and sending a few of them to the next one in order to increase the chance of mutations and having the largest population.

Tribe
-----

This phase allows to setup a campfire and starting to research some technologies and new society behavior. The creatures are starting to build some basic building (campfire, basic tool workshop, ...).

Planetary Civilization
----------------------

This phase starts the economy and ecology parts of the game. The creatures starts to create cities (now multiple town center are possible) and with modern technology.

Galactic Civilization
---------------------

Now the creatures are able to travel around the galaxy and colonize other planets. The victory conditions become available.
