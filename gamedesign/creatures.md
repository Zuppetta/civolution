# Creatures

In this era, the players control the evolution of his creature and decide where a group should migrate. This phase will not allow any construction, but only to choose to split a group of creatures between two cases (with a risk of loosing some during the process of colonizing the new tile). This phase could be with a coarse mesh (in order to give a sensation of global colonization by the creatures).
The ressources at this point should be only the food (vegetal or animal), the mutation, the solar and the thermal energies.
Some currents should be present in order to facilitate a displacement or not.
