Evolution branches allowed only in certain places (e.g. walking on earth). Player can be on the same place.
The earth should give a feeling of change (creation of vulcano, desert, ...).
The evolution can gives a flying creature or an aquatic one.

This phase start the technology and social aspects of the game and slow the evolution process (the aim is having 1-2 transformations possible until the end of the game). In order to discuss with other civilization, some technology/social capacities are required.


Planetary Civilization

This phase start the economy aspect and grows a lot the technology tree. Only one alliance is allowed to win the earth (the others are relocated on another world with a disadvantage except if a technology for leaving earth is completed).
The ecology becomes a problem and can make a civilization loosing the game.
