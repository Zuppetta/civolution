# Gameplay/Idea

The symbiosis gives bonus or disadvantage depending on the two civilizations.
Player eliminated can choose a new planet to colonize in order to remain in the game.
The life is not only a carbon based one.
Planet divided in different parts and offers different advantage and direction for the civilization. Different parts can change with random modifications (e.g. asteroid).
(nice to do, evolution tree as DNA)
Alliance should have a scale giving more (dis)advantage. Disadvantage for symbiosis if planet colonized by only one.
The other players should be able to destroy symbiosis.
The symbiosis gameplay should allows different methods (e.g. everyone build whatever they want or they vote).
Symbiosis can be done with more than 1 civ.
New conditions of victory at early stages and allows player to choose which eras they play.

Military units are grouped in armies and the main cost of military comes from the number of armies
Units need water in order to survive in desert.
To discover a new ressource, a scientist (unit) need to find it.
